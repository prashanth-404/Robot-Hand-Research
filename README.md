# Robot-Hand-Research
Just the research aspect of building a robot hand,
did not actually work on it(hands on)
Quicktip- If you're in a short term project and don't wanna do all the assembling and 3d modelling, consider the ada hand v2 by open bionics, it has the elastic 3d printable structure...so you only need to 3d print 4 parts(Hope you are not planning on 3d printing servos).
